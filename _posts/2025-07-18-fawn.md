## üß† Summary

Hack The Box's **Fawn** is a very easy Linux machine that demonstrates the security risk of enabling **anonymous FTP login**. We will connect to the HTB network, enumerate services using Nmap, log in to FTP without credentials, and retrieve the flag.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **OpenVPN** ‚Äì To connect to HTB labs
- **Ping** ‚Äì For connectivity check
- **Nmap** ‚Äì For service enumeration
- **FTP Client** ‚Äì For file download via anonymous login

## üñ•Ô∏è Target Info

- IP: `10.129.170.179`
- OS: Unix
- Service: FTP (vsftpd 3.0.3)

### Key Takeaways
- Anonymous FTP access is a critical misconfiguration because it allows anyone to read or upload files without authentication.
- FTP transmits credentials in plaintext, making it insecure.
- Always disable anonymous FTP access and use SFTP or SCP for secure transfers.
