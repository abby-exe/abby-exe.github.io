## üéØ My Experience

![Session 1](/assets/img/events/osint/sesh1.jpg)

This was my first official OSINT session under 0day, and it was both exciting and challenging. The session introduced the fundamentals of intelligence, then moved into practical OSINT workflows using tools and techniques that investigators rely on.

The highlight was the CTF hands-on, where we put our learning into practice by solving real-world style challenges. Out of 7 challenges, I successfully solved all the given challenges üéâ ‚Äî covering areas like digital footprint tracing, public records lookups, and open-source investigation platforms.

## ‚úÖ Challenges (brief) ‚Äî What they asked & How I solved them

![Session 1 Challenges](/assets/img/events/osint/sesh1challenge2.jpg)

Below are condensed challenge descriptions and the approach I used (no flags included):

- **Corruption records lookup:**
Task: Verify if a candidate had corruption convictions.
Approach: Start with authoritative sources ‚Äî government portals and court databases; corroborate with mainstream news archives.

- **Legal classification lookup:**
Task: Find statutory classification of a convicted individual.
Approach: Locate the offender entry on the official corruption registry and extract the exact offence wording and statutory section.

- **Website reconnaissance (IP & hosting):**
Task: Resolve a company domain to IP and identify hosting.
Approach: nslookup / dig ‚Üí capture A records ‚Üí whois on IP to determine ASN/registrant (confirmed GitHub Pages / Fastly CDN).

- **CDN identification:**
Task: Identify CDN used to serve the site.
Approach: Follow CNAME chains and check response headers; corroborate with IP ranges / whois to map to CDN provider / I found it in Shodan using the IP Address found in `nslookup` **185.199.111.153**.

- **Malware/sample tracing (hash ‚Üí report):**
Task: Given a SHA256 and filename, find the public analysis/report.
Approach: Search sandboxes and threat intel platforms (VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, Triage, FileScan), pivot on ‚ÄúRelations‚Äù and sandbox comments, and use exact-hash Google dorks and inurl:/report filters to find printable report endpoints.
