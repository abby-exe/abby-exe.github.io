## ‚úÖ Challenges (brief) ‚Äî What they asked & How I solved them

![Session 1 Challenges](/assets/img/events/osint/sesh1challenge2.jpg)

Below are condensed challenge descriptions and the approach I used (no flags included):

- **Corruption records lookup:**
Task: Verify if a candidate had corruption convictions.
Approach: Start with authoritative sources ‚Äî government portals and court databases; corroborate with mainstream news archives.

- **Legal classification lookup:**
Task: Find statutory classification of a convicted individual.
Approach: Locate the offender entry on the official corruption registry and extract the exact offence wording and statutory section.

- **Website reconnaissance (IP & hosting):**
Task: Resolve a company domain to IP and identify hosting.
Approach: nslookup / dig ‚Üí capture A records ‚Üí whois on IP to determine ASN/registrant (confirmed GitHub Pages / Fastly CDN).

- **CDN identification:**
Task: Identify CDN used to serve the site.
Approach: Follow CNAME chains and check response headers; corroborate with IP ranges / whois to map to CDN provider / I found it in Shodan using the IP Address found in `nslookup` **185.199.111.153**.

- **Malware/sample tracing (hash ‚Üí report):**
Task: Given a SHA256 and filename, find the public analysis/report.
Approach: Search sandboxes and threat intel platforms (VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, Triage, FileScan), pivot on ‚ÄúRelations‚Äù and sandbox comments, and use exact-hash Google dorks and inurl:/report filters to find printable report endpoints.

## üïµüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è X's Advance Search (Live Activity)

I used X‚Äôs advanced search to hunt for scam/phishing related posts mentioning major Malaysian organisations ‚Äî the exact query I used:

```bash
(scam OR spam OR phish OR phishing OR legit OR link OR url OR hack OR sms) 
(@MCMC_RASMI OR @Petronas OR @ShopeeMY OR @LazadaMY OR @GrabMY OR @MaxisListens 
OR @Maxis OR @CelcomDigi OR @CIMBMalaysia OR @posmalaysia OR @umobile OR @MyMaybank 
OR @Tenaga_Nasional OR @mytouchngo OR @jntexpressmy) until:2024-12-31 since:2024-01-01
```

This returned public posts that mentioned potential phishing/scam activity targeting customers of those brands within 2024.

## üéØ My Experience

![Session 3](/assets/img/events/osint/sesh3.jpg)
During Session 3, Mr.Nazrul began by revisiting the challenge from Session 1, demonstrating how to solve it using DNSDumpster. Through this, we learned how an organization‚Äôs IP addresses, CDN information, and related DNS records can be discovered as part of its exposed digital footprint. The session then moved into the concept of an Information Attack Space, where various tools used for reconnaissance, scanning, and monitoring were introduced. Tools like Nmap were explained for active scanning and service discovery, while Microsoft Defender was mentioned as an example of a commercial endpoint detection solution. The instructor emphasized the importance of combining open-source and commercial tools depending on an organization‚Äôs size and security needs.

We were also introduced to Feedly, a platform that helps cybersecurity professionals stay updated with the latest security news, threat intelligence feeds, and blog posts in one place. Similarly, Cybersecurity Explorer by Henry Adrian was highlighted as a useful resource for exploring cybersecurity domains, tools, and research content. Next, we learned about the MITRE ATT&CK Framework, which provides a globally recognized structure for understanding attacker behavior through tactics and techniques, helping organizations build intelligence-driven defenses.

The instructor then demonstrated how to use Google Alerts to create automated keyword-based notifications for monitoring specific terms like company names or data leaks ‚Äî a simple yet powerful method for brand and threat monitoring. The discussion continued with an overview of the Deep Web, Dark Web, and Tor, explaining how the deep web contains unindexed content, while the dark web is intentionally hidden and accessible via the Tor network for anonymity. Finally, we explored Archive.ph, a website used to take and preserve snapshots of web pages, which is extremely useful for OSINT investigations when content gets deleted or taken down.

Overall, this session provided a deeper understanding of how organizations can be mapped, monitored, and protected through OSINT techniques, digital footprint awareness, and intelligence-driven defense practices.

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Challenge Explanation: Tracing the Web Defacement (Session 3)

**Background:**
A day after the strange text appeared on the company‚Äôs website, the CSIRT (Cyber Security Incident Response Team) received reports that the official website, dayaterasdinamik.my, had shown unusual content. By the time the team began investigating, the site had already returned to normal. Fortunately, the MSSP (Managed Security Service Provider) ‚Äî which functions as CSIRT Level 2 ‚Äî managed to capture a saved snapshot of the defaced page using one of their digital footprint monitoring tools (as mentioned in the ‚ÄúExposing Organization‚Äôs Digital Footprint‚Äù slide).

My task was to identify where the company‚Äôs website was hosted and who was responsible for uploading the altered content.

## **üîç Step-by-Step Investigation Process:-**

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Identifying the Hosting Platform

The first step was to determine where the website was hosted.
I analyzed the A records and WHOIS information of dayaterasdinamik.my.
The DNS results showed IP addresses in the range `185.199.108.0/24`, which belongs to `ASN 54113 (Fastly, United States)` ‚Äî the same network used by GitHub Pages.

- Commands used:
```bash
dig +short dayaterasdinamik.my A
whois 185.199.109.153
curl -I https://dayaterasdinamik.my
```

The response headers and network traces confirmed that the website used GitHub Pages for hosting, with Fastly as the CDN and Varnish as the caching layer.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Checking Archived Snapshots (Wayback Machine)

Next, I checked if there were any saved versions of the website using Wayback Machine and archive.ph.

The MSSP snapshot revealed the altered page content ‚Äî and I found a hidden flag within the HTML source:

`OSINT{W4yb4ck_iz_4w350M3}`

This proved that the attacker‚Äôs defacement was preserved in the archived copy, even though the live site was restored.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Finding the GitHub Repository

Since the site was hosted on GitHub Pages, I started searching for related repositories that might contain the website‚Äôs source code.
Using GitHub search and domain-based hints (dayaterasdinamik.my), I found the public repository linked to the organization.

Once located, I opened the Commits tab to inspect the commit history for any unusual uploads or modifications.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Extracting Commit Metadata

To determine who made the changes, I viewed the commit in raw patch format by appending .patch to the commit URL:
```
https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/commit/<sha>.patch
https://api.github.com/users/<GITHUB USERNAME>/events/public - To find emails and username
https://api.github.com/repos/<GITHUB USERNAME>/<GITHUB PAGE> - To find more information
```

This revealed the Git metadata, including the username and email of the person who made the commit:

```
"email": "admin@dayaterasdinamik.my",
"name": "dayaterasdinamikadmin"
```

However, this wasn‚Äôt the only commit. After deeper analysis, I discovered that the real admin account involved in altering the website was:

dayaterasdinamikadmin_admin@dayaterasdinamik.my

So, the final flag format was:

`OSINT{dayaterasdinamikadmin_admin@dayaterasdinamik.my}`

## üéØ My Experience

![Session 4](/assets/img/events/osint/sesh4.jpg)
In this session, I explored one of the most powerful tools for OSINT investigations **Maltego**. It was a hands-on and highly visual session where I learned how to map digital footprints and uncover hidden connections between people, organizations, domains, and infrastructure.

Mr.Nazrul, walked us through the Maltego Graph interface, showing how each node and edge represents a real-world relationship. I especially liked how the platform makes it easy to visualize complex data that would otherwise take hours to piece together manually.

We also learned how to use Maltego Transforms to automatically gather and enrich data from multiple public sources. This part was eye-opening ‚Äî with just a few clicks, we could pull information like DNS records, email associations, and linked social media profiles.

Towards the end, we explored Custom Entities and External Integrations, which allow analysts to extend Maltego‚Äôs capabilities using APIs and third-party data. This gave me a good understanding of how Maltego fits into a broader OSINT workflow and how it can be integrated with other tools or databases for deeper investigations.

Overall, Session 4 helped me understand the true power of visual link analysis in OSINT and how data relationships can reveal patterns that text-based methods might miss. It was a great continuation of the previous sessions ‚Äî moving from manual searches to automation and visualization.
