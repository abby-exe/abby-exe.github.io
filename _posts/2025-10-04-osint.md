## üéØ My Experience

![Session 1](/assets/img/events/osint/sesh1.jpg)

This was my first official OSINT session under 0day, and it was both exciting and challenging. The session introduced the fundamentals of intelligence, then moved into practical OSINT workflows using tools and techniques that investigators rely on.

The highlight was the CTF hands-on, where we put our learning into practice by solving real-world style challenges. Out of 7 challenges, I successfully solved all the given challenges üéâ ‚Äî covering areas like digital footprint tracing, public records lookups, and open-source investigation platforms.

## ‚úÖ Challenges (brief) ‚Äî What they asked & How I solved them

![Session 1 Challenges](/assets/img/events/osint/sesh1challenge2.jpg)

Below are condensed challenge descriptions and the approach I used (no flags included):

- **Corruption records lookup:**
Task: Verify if a candidate had corruption convictions.
Approach: Start with authoritative sources ‚Äî government portals and court databases; corroborate with mainstream news archives.

- **Legal classification lookup:**
Task: Find statutory classification of a convicted individual.
Approach: Locate the offender entry on the official corruption registry and extract the exact offence wording and statutory section.

- **Website reconnaissance (IP & hosting):**
Task: Resolve a company domain to IP and identify hosting.
Approach: nslookup / dig ‚Üí capture A records ‚Üí whois on IP to determine ASN/registrant (confirmed GitHub Pages / Fastly CDN).

- **CDN identification:**
Task: Identify CDN used to serve the site.
Approach: Follow CNAME chains and check response headers; corroborate with IP ranges / whois to map to CDN provider / I found it in Shodan using the IP Address found in `nslookup` **185.199.111.153**.

- **Malware/sample tracing (hash ‚Üí report):**
Task: Given a SHA256 and filename, find the public analysis/report.
Approach: Search sandboxes and threat intel platforms (VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, Triage, FileScan), pivot on ‚ÄúRelations‚Äù and sandbox comments, and use exact-hash Google dorks and inurl:/report filters to find printable report endpoints.

- **Event:** OSINT by 0day
- **Speaker:** Nazrul Affiq
- **Format:** Live Virtual (Zoom)

## üîç Topics Covered
- Social Media Intelligence (SOCMINT)
- Leveraging Data Breaches for OSINT investigation
- Profiling Individuals to Hunt Cyber Criminals
- Practical Individual's OSINT (CTF Hands-on)

## üéØ My Experience

![Session 2](/assets/img/events/osint/sesh2.jpg)
Session 2 focused on SOCMINT (Social Media Intelligence) and practical techniques for uncovering individual digital trails. The session demonstrated advanced search techniques on X (formerly Twitter), how to triage suspicious URLs, and how to pivot from social chatter to technical artefacts (URL scans, sandbox reports, and analyst write-ups). 

Mr.Nazrul also briefly showed few of the tools from the list below.

---

## üíª Tools & Quick Uses (Session Highlights)

- VirusTotal ‚Äî centralized aggregation of antivirus detections, URLs, relationships, and external sandbox links.
  Tip: Paste a hash/URL and check Relations for sandbox reports.

- Tria.ge (Hatching Triage) ‚Äî automated dynamic analysis sandbox with public task pages.
  Tip: Useful for quick behavioral snapshots and downloadable PCAPs/screenshots.

- Any.run ‚Äî interactive malware sandbox (replayable runs, screenshots, network traces).
  Tip: Great when you need to step through execution manually and capture UX screens.

- Polyswarm ‚Äî crowd-sourced malware detection marketplace and sandbox results.
  Tip: Use for alternate vendor verdicts when VT or Hybrid disagree.

- Zulu / Zscaler ‚Äî enterprise web filtering / security telemetry ‚Äî useful for context on blocked/malicious domains.
  Tip: Check if a domain is known-malicious in enterprise filters.

- ViewDNS ‚Äî multi-purpose DNS & historic DNS lookup tools (reverse whois, reverse IP).
  Tip: Use reverse IP to find other domains hosted on same IP.

- Sucuri Site Check ‚Äî website scanner for malcode, blacklist status, and basic security headers.
  Tip: Quick way to see if a site is flagged by common blacklists.

- AlienVault OTX ‚Äî community-driven IOC sharing (pulses) and enrichment.
  Tip: Search pulses for domain/hash to find campaign context and related IOCs.

- URLscan.io ‚Äî live URL triage: screenshots, redirect chains, loaded resources, and hosting info.
  Tip: Submit suspicious links and use the screenshot+resources for evidence and pivoting.

- Lookyloo ‚Äî web page archival and resource-graphing; good for visualizing site structure and scripts.
  Tip: Use it to see how resources are connected and spot suspicious third-party scripts.

- Vulnerability Lookup ‚Äî (enum tooling) check CVEs or known vulnerabilities associated with services.
  Tip: Map exposed services to CVEs for attack surface assessment.

- Certificate Search ‚Äî find TLS certificates, associated domains, and issuance history (eg. crt.sh).
  Tip: Use certificate common names / SANs to pivot between related domains.

- AbuseIPDB ‚Äî community-reported malicious IPs and abuse scoring.
  Tip: Quickly validate if an IP has prior abuse reports before blocking or investigating.

- ThreatFox ‚Äî Malware & IoC sharing (abuse.ch project family) ‚Äî quick lookups for malicious domains and URLs.
  Tip: Great for finding active malware campaigns and downloadable samples.

- Malware Bazaar ‚Äî repository of malware samples (abuse.ch).
  Tip: Search by hash to find sample metadata, tags, and download links; often links to sandbox runs.

## üïµüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è X's Advance Search (Live Activity)

I used X‚Äôs advanced search to hunt for scam/phishing related posts mentioning major Malaysian organisations ‚Äî the exact query I used:

```bash
(scam OR spam OR phish OR phishing OR legit OR link OR url OR hack OR sms) 
(@MCMC_RASMI OR @Petronas OR @ShopeeMY OR @LazadaMY OR @GrabMY OR @MaxisListens 
OR @Maxis OR @CelcomDigi OR @CIMBMalaysia OR @posmalaysia OR @umobile OR @MyMaybank 
OR @Tenaga_Nasional OR @mytouchngo OR @jntexpressmy) until:2024-12-31 since:2024-01-01
```

This returned public posts that mentioned potential phishing/scam activity targeting customers of those brands within 2024.

## ‚úÖ Challenges (Individual Footprinting)

For the final challenges in Session 2, I applied a combination of open-source intelligence techniques:
- Identity Verification: Found the victim's IC through Google search and Google Images.
- Voter Information: Checked the registered voting area using the MySPR Semak portal.

These steps allowed me to accurately map the target‚Äôs public information and complete the challenge.
